Detecting bias in social media data

At present, large amounts of data which is about petabytes of data is
generated online on daily basis. There is no place where the data flood
is more obvious than in social media. Utilizing this unheralded stream
of data is an active area of research. Social media networks have evolved
into scaled down research facilities for human experimentation. This
social media data is mainly considered by various researchers, services and
practitioners to study the biased nature for research purpose.
Mainly the social media data can be found in various forms such as
reviews, tweets, comments, hashtags, images, captions and so on. But with
extensive use of this mode of communications, more challenges are rising
with social media. One of the core challenge is the opinion bias in data.
These opinions are expressed in terms of reviews, tweets and ratings based
on certain parameters.
The main challenge about opinions is the accuracy and truthfulness of
the data. In day to day life, various kinds of fake news are getting spread in
relation to politics, cinema, climatic conditions and even if the news are
real, there are some biased opinions and views presented by different me-
dia houses, critics and users. This proposed work is based on the detection
of such biases in various kinds of data. This thesis work is mainly focusing
on the biases in reviews provided on website rotten tomatoes. Along with
rotten tomatoes data, it will provide comparative analysis on user reviews
and critics review differences, as well as it will also make use of sentiment
analysis technique to represent by which intention the reviews are written.
It will also provide the performance in terms of accuracy in the form of
tables and graphs.
